# Backstory
- Rogue (Swashbuckler)
- Far Traveler
- Neutral Good

Theodore Baxter Dodgerton III comes from an old family of halflings. Mother and father own and operate a local bakery 
in his home town.
While he likes his home and appreciates the upbringing he was given, he was always an adventurous one, his brains and
inquisitiveness getting him into trouble.
For most of his younger years, he traveled as much as he could, seeking out cool items and new people.
His penchant for cool items led him to several instances of theivery, hence the rogue.

# Secrets
- He is a tremendous cook, though he doesn't get to do it as often as he would wish.

# Bonds
- Loves his home town, laments leaving it. In his mind, the only way he can return is if he can prove that he's made it
  honestly in the world

# Flaws
- Believes that he needs to act tougher than he really is. In the circles he runs in, he's needed to adopt a no-nonsense
  person to get along. But really, he comes from a pretty cushy background. He tries very hard to keep these worlds
  separate
- Very attracted to shiny things. He really loves a good treasure and thats a great way to get him to think stupidly.
  Note, treasure doesn't have to be expensive, could also be useful or rare

# Goals

## Revenge on the Redbrands
Eventually, he ended up in Phandolin searching for `<FILL THIS IN ITEM>`.
He found work with a group called the Redbrands, mostly working as a fence/thief. 
Somehow he has made an enemy of someone in the Redbrands.
On their word, [Glasstaff](../npcs/glasstaff.md) tried to have me killed.
He escaped, barely alive, and fled Phandolin with pretty much nothing to his name.

- [ ] Talk to [Halia Thornton](../npcs/halia_thornton.md). 
    Someone tipped you off that she also has it in for the Redbrands.
    She is somewhere in the city.
- [ ] Find out who sold you out in this gang
- [ ] Get revenge, on that person, on Glasstaff, possibly on the Redbrands as a whole.
- [ ] *It is unknown if Glasstaff was in on the gig or what.*
