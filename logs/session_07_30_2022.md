# Thoughts
+ Really nice opening game
+ Finished out the entire first session pretty much
+ Defeated Klarg!
+ Did a fair amount of sneaking
+ Saved Sildar, and he sort of helped us through the dungeon
+ I screwed up some dudes with some clutch criticals
+ We hit level 2

- Did I deal too much damage?
